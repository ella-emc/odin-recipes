# odin-recipes

This page contains the recipes of my favorite dishes. All of them are food I enjoy eating whenever I feel sad, happy, hangry, and frustrated.

For this project, I used basic HTML to write the code. I started this project with basic knowledge of HTML, and I hope that as I proceed with the project, I learn new things about HTML elements.
