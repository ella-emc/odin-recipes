# odin-recipes

This page contains the recipes of my favorite dishes. All of them are food I enjoy eating whenever I feel sad, happy, hangry, and frustrated.

For this project, I used basic HTML to write the code. I started this project with basic knowledge of HTML, and I hope that as I proceed with the project, I learn new things about HTML elements.

After finishing this recipe assignment, I utilized all that I have learned so far from TOP's HTML lessons and supplemental materials. I demonstrated the use of attributes, git commit messages, and linking images and absolute/relative pages. I hope to improve this assignment in the future by adding CSS elements.

I have had difficulties with doing commits on the VS Code terminal, but I always went back to the article on how to write commit messages efficiently whenever I wasn't sure of what I'm doing. Fortunately, I was able to overcome these difficulties (I hope).

This README file serves as my short reflection and synthesis of what I demonstrated and overcame. I hope to learn more about web developing in the future.
