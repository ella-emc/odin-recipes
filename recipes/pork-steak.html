        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pork Steak is the perfect manifestation of the combination 'sweet and spicy.' 
            In this dish, the pork is previously marinated in soy sauce, lemon (or calamansi) juice with added condiments like 
            pepper and sugar. Pork steak is a dish more suitably served with rice and a cool beverage during lunch or dinner. Check out the content

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 lbs. pork chop</li>
            <li>1 piece yellow onion</li>
            <li>3/4 cups soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 piece lemon</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic (chopped)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Place pork chops in a resealable bag. Pour soy sauce into the bag and squeeze-in lemon. Blend all ingredients. Seal the bag and marinate for at least one hour.</li>
            <li>Drain the excess marinade. Set it aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil on a pan or use cooking oil spray. Pan-fry marinated pork chops for 1 Â½ minutes per side. Remove pork chops from the pan. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Add 3 tablespoons cooking oil on the same pan. Saute garlic and half of the onions once the oil starts to get hot.</li>
            <li>Once onion softens, pour beef broth and pour the remaining marinade. Let boil.</li>
            <li>Put pork chops back into the pan. Cover and cook in medium heat for 20 minutes. Note: add more broth as necessary.</li>
            <li>Turn the pork chops over. Cover and cook in medium heat for 18 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season with sugar and ground black pepper. Add remaining onions. Cook for 8 minutes.</li>
